## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
|------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
|**library** | **String** | The name of the library that created this file. |  [optional] |
|**version** | **String** | The version of the library that created this file.  Because we cannot assume that the library is semantically versioned, this is a string.  However, if it is semantically versioned, it should be a valid semver string without any &#39;v&#39; prefix.  For example: &#x60;2.0.0&#x60;, &#x60;2.0.0-rc.1&#x60;.  |  [optional] |
