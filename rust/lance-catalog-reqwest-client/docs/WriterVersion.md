# WriterVersion

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**library** | Option<**String**> | The name of the library that created this file. | [optional]
**version** | Option<**String**> | The version of the library that created this file.  Because we cannot assume that the library is semantically versioned, this is a string.  However, if it is semantically versioned, it should be a valid semver string without any 'v' prefix.  For example: `2.0.0`, `2.0.0-rc.1`.  | [optional]
