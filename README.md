# Lance Catalog Integrations

A catalog is, at a minimum, anything that represents a collection of tables, often referred to as a database or schema.  
Typically these catalogs will often group together collections of databases into a "namespace" or "catalog" 
(different tools have different names).  We want these tools to be able to integrate with Lance tables.  
This may be a simple read-only integration where these tools are able to query Lance tables or it may be 
a more complex integration where these tools can create and manage Lance tables.  
This repository can be a home for these integrations.
